# Project Name

jQuery Salary Calculator


## Description

This app allow the user (an employer) to enter employee data into a table.
The collective employees annual salaries are calculated into a monthly cost of for employer.
If the monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the user is warned by a red highlight of the cost.

Employees can be deleted from the table (and collective salaries) and the month updates to reflect this.


## Learnin' Stuff
I learned how to manipulte a complex DOM using jQuery and Javascript. Appending items within items made it difficult to track and target elements. 
Adding a fair share of math stuff that was to happen behind the scenes taught me to compartmentalize and seperate different logic (things can get very tangled and buggy if you don't!).
